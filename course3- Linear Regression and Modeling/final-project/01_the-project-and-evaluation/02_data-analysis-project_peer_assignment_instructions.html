  Congratulations on getting a job as a data scientist at Paramount Pictures!
 </p>
 <p>
  Your boss has just acquired data about how much audiences and critics like movies as well as numerous other variables about the movies. This dataset is provided below, and it includes information from
  <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/">
   Rotten Tomatoes
  </a>
  and
  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">
   IMDB
  </a>
  for a random sample of movies.
 </p>
 <p>
  She is interested in learning what attributes make a movie popular. She is also interested in learning something new about movies. She wants you team to figure it all out.
 </p>
 <p>
  As part of this project you will complete exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling, and prediction.
 </p>
 <p>
  All template and rubric files that you will need to complete this project can be found on the
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-regression-model/supplement/LDoCh/project-information">

  <strong>
   IMPORTANT:
  </strong>
  Analyses completed using software other than R, or not written up using R Markdown, will receive a 0 on the project regardless of their content.
 </p>
 <p>
  Your project will consist of 6 parts:
 </p>
 <ol bullettype="numbers">
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Data
    </strong>
    : (3 points) Describe how the observations in the sample are collected, and the implications of this data collection method on the scope of inference (generalizability / causality).
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Research question
    </strong>
    : (3 points) Come up with a research question that you want to answer using these data and a multiple linear regression model. You should phrase your research question in a way that matches up with the scope of inference your dataset allows for. You are welcomed to create new variables based on existing ones. Along with your research question include a brief discussion (1-2 sentences) as to why this question is of interest to you and/or your audience.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     EDA
    </strong>
    : (10 points) Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) that addresses the research question you outlined above. Your EDA should contain numerical summaries and visualizations. Your EDA does not have to touch on every single variable that you are considering for your model, but what you choose to present should be a deliberate (not haphazard) selection. This might mean you initially create a lot more visualizations and summary statistics than what you finally choose to include in your paper. Each R output and plot should be accompanied by a brief interpretation.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Modeling:
    </strong>
    (20 points) Develop a multiple linear regression model to predict a numerical variable in the dataset. The response variable and the explanatory variables can be existing variables in the dataset, or new variables you create based on existing variables.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Prediction:
    </strong>
    (5 points) Pick a movie from 2016 (a new movie that is not in the sample) and do a prediction for this movie using your the model you developed and the `predict` function in R. Also quantify the uncertainty around this prediction using an appropriate interval.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Conclusion:
    </strong>
    (3 points)A brief summary of your findings from the previous sections
    <strong>
     without
    </strong>
    repeating your statements from earlier as well as a discussion of what you have learned about the data and your research question. You should also discuss any shortcomings of your current study (either due to data collection or methodology) and include ideas for possible future research.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  In addition to these parts, there are also 6 points allocated to format, overall organization, and readability of your project. Total points add up to 50 points. See the assessment rubric on the
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-regression-model/supplement/LDoCh/project-information">
   Project Files and Rubric
  </a>
  page for more details on how your peers will evaluate your work.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can begin working on the project immediately. Please save your work as you go along. When you're ready to submit your work for evaluation, remember to click the "Submit" button.
 </p>
 <p>
  After you submit your proposal, please provide feedback to others on their projects. Please assess at least 3 projects. This peer assessment will not only provide you with experience with a data set and research questions but also prepare for your projects in the future courses in the Specialization.
