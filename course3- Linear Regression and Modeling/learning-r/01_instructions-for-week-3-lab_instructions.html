  Install R packages:
 </h2>
 <h3 level="3">
  Install and load devtools:
 </h3>
 <p>
  We will use the devtools package to install the statsr package associated with this course. We need to install and load this package. Launch RStudio, and the following commands in the
  <strong>
   Console
  </strong>
  :
 </p>
 <pre language="r">install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)</pre>
 <h3 level="3">
  Install all other packages:
 </h3>
 <p>
  Now we can install the rest of the packages we will use in this lab. Type the following commands in the
  <strong>
   Console
  </strong>
  as well:
 </p>
 <pre language="r">install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install_github("StatsWithR/statsr")
</pre>
 <p>
  The uses of these packages will be discussed in detail in the lab(s).
 </p>
 <p>
  If install_github breaks on Windows with UNC network paths or sometimes when there are places in the path name, you may follow our mentor David Hood's (thanks, David) solution
