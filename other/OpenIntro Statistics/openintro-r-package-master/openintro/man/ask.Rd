\title{How important is it to ask pointed questions?}
\description{
  In this experiment, each individual was asked to be a seller of an iPod
  (a product commonly used to store music on before smart phones...).
  They participant received $10 + 5\% of the sale price for participating.
  The iPod they were selling had frozen twice in the past inexplicitly but
  otherwise worked fine. The prospective buyer starts off and then asks
  one of three final questions, depending on the seller's treatment group.

  The three possible questions:
  \itemize{
    \item{General: What can you tell me about it?}
    \item{Positive Assumption: It doesn't have any problems, does it?}
    \item{Negative Assumption: What problems does it have?}
  }

  The outcome variable is whether or not the participant discloses
  or hides the problem with the iPod.
}
