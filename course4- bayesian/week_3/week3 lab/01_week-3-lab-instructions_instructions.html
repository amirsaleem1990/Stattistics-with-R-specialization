 <p>
  Install the packages we will use in this lab.
 </p>
 <p>
  Type the following commands in the Console:
 </p>
 <pre language="r">install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("statsr")
install.packages("PairedData")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")</pre>
 <p>
 </p>
 <h3 level="3">
  2. Load other packages:
 </h3>
 <pre language="r">library(statsr)
library(PairedData)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)</pre>
 <p>
  The use of these packages will be discussed in detail in the lab.
 </p>

  Download and Run the Lab File:
 </h2>
 <p>
  Next, download the R Markdown file linked below, open it in RStudio, and click on
  <strong>
   Knit
  </strong>
  . This document contains the instructions for the lab.

  <strong>
   IMPORTANT
  </strong>
  : Use right-click (Ctrl+click on mac), then choose "Save link as..." to save the below R Markdown file. If Chrome doesn't work, switch to Firefox or other browsers when downloading the file. You may need to change the file extension to $$\verb|.Rmd|$$ by hand after downloading. You must download and
  <strong>
   knit
  </strong>
  this file and be able to view the instructions in it to complete the Week 3 Lab. So make sure to complete these steps before starting the lab.

  As you go through the contents of the lab instructions document you will encounter multiple choice questions, make sure to
  <strong>
   submit your answers to those questions in the lab quiz
  </strong>
  (next item in the course) to get credit. The ones marked with "Exercise" in the Rmd file are for your own practice -- you don't need to submit your answers to them. If any of your answers is incorrect, please check your code and try again!
