# But we usually consider the relative frequencies when evaluating the distributions of categorical variables.
# So, how are bar plots different than histograms? 
1- First, bar plots are used for displaying distributions of categorical variables, while histograms are used for
numerical variables. 
2- Second, the axis in a histogram is a number line. Hence, the orders of the bars cannot be changed. While in a bar plot, the categories can be listed in any order, though some orderings make more sense than others, especially for original variables.
# A pie chart is actually much less informative then a bar plot. 
1- First, while it tells us the relative ordering of the levels, it doesn't actually tell us what percentage of
the distribution falls into which level. 
2- Second, when there are many levels in a categorical variable with similar relative frequencies, it might be difficult to determine which level is more highly represented just by looking at a pie chart.
# An obvious choice for visualizing two categorical variables is a segmented bar plot. Segmented bar plots are useful for visualizing conditional frequency distributions. In other words, the distribution of the levels of one variable, the response variable, conditioned on the levels of the other, the explanatory variable.
# So, while segmented bar plots are useful for visualizing frequency distributions
# Another alternative is a mosaic plot. A mosaic plot like this one, displays the distribution of feelings about difficulty of saving money, conditional on income as well. It also shows the marginal distribution of income, too. 
# So, let's start with the marginal distribution. The width of the bars is what's telling us
about the marginal distribution of income. We can see that more people make less than
40,000 have been surveyed than any other. Now, let's look at the breakdown
of the individual bars. Among those who make less than 40,000, we had seen that 63% think it's
very difficult to save money. These respondents are represented
by the segment in the first bar. Similarly, 43% of those who
make between 40 and 80,000, and 25% of those who make more than 80,000,
and 35% of those who refused to share their income, are represented in the first
segment within their respective bars. Visually, without relying on the relative
percentages we calculated earlier, we can see that the length of the segments
representing those who think it's very difficult to save money
vary by income level. Indicating a difference of opinion among
members of different income groups, hence suggesting a relationship
between the two variables. We could, of course, examine the other
levels of the opinion variable as well. So far in this video we discussed how to
describe the distribution of a single categorical variable, and how to evaluate the relationship
between two categorical variables. To wrap up our discussion on exploratory
data analysis with categorical variables, let's talk about one last
type of relationship. The relationship between a numerical
variable and a categorical variable. This type of relationship is
something we usually consider when comparing the distribution
of a numerical variable across the levels of
a categorical variable. For example,
here we have a box plot of number of clubs college students are involved
with and their class year. The medians are pretty consistent,
indicating that on average, students belong to roughly equal numbers
of clubs regardless of their year. The variability is higher for
first-year and senior students, while much lower for sophomores and
juniors, as indicated by the lower IQRs. And among the sophomores and juniors, there are some students who belong to
unusually low or high numbers of clubs. The distributions across the class years
are pretty similar, suggesting that number of clubs students belong to might
be independent of their class year.
