In this brief video, we will define
what we mean by robust statistics and discuss robust measures of center and
spread. We define robust statistics
as measures on which extreme observations have little effect. Let's give a quick example. We start with a small data set of values
between one and six, and the mean and the median for these data are both 3.5. What if we change one of the values
in the data set to be much larger? Say 1000. The mean increases greatly, but
the median stays the same at 3.5. In other words, the mean is robust
to the extreme observation. This is because while the mean depends
on all observations in the data set, it is the arithmetic average, after all. The median only depends on
the midpoint of the distribution and the values of the end point
are irrelevant to its calculation. We just established that the median is
a more robust statistic of center than the mean. Going along with this the IQR, which is
based on the median, is a more robust statistic than the standard deviation
which is calculated using the mean. As well as range which relies solely
on the most extreme observations. Robust statistics are most useful for
describing skewed distributions, or those with extreme observations. While non-robust statistics like mean and
standard deviation are useful for describing symmetric distributions
